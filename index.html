    <p><a href="http://github.com/rfreebern/zeitgeist.css" title="zeitgeist.css on Github">zeitgeist.css</a> is a crowdsourced, extendable basic CSS file that imparts a design based on current design aesthetics to any simple HTML file, such as those produced by compiling <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown" title="Daring Fireball: Markdown">markdown</a>.</p>

    <p>zeitgeist.css has the following goals:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Enable any HTML page to maintain a modern appearance effortlessly.</li>
        <li>Ensure any page can easily embrace basic design best practices for readability, usability, accessibility, and compatibility.</li>
        <li>Provide a central repository for community knowledge and examples of these best practices, and a history of how they change over time.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>zeitgeist.css contains basic CSS normalization and best practices from <a href="http://h5bp.com" title="HTML5 Boilerplate">HTML5 Boilerplate</a>. Responsive design rules for desktop, tablets, and mobile phones are included, a set of styles for printing, and styles for projectors as well.</p>

    <h2>The spirit of the time</h2>

    <p>Any page that links to the current version of zeitgeist.css will have a design that changes as zeitgeist.css changes. These changes are based on contributions and community decisions regarding the current state of web aesthetics, technology, and platform support.</p>

    <p>Alternatively, a page can use a zeitgeist.css revision for any point in time in order to present a design reminiscent of that time period. The repository is tagged at the end of every month in order to facilitate linking to a revision from a specific point in time.</p>
